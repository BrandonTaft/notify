For a professional look, here are the best background styles you can use:

Neutral Gradient or Solid Color – Light gray, blue, or white backgrounds look clean and work well for LinkedIn or business profiles.
Subtle Blur Background – A softly blurred office or coworking space makes you stand out while maintaining professionalism.
Bookshelf or Elegant Wood Paneling – Works well for academic, legal, or consulting professions.
Outdoor with Soft Focus – A well-lit, blurred natural background can give a fresh and approachable look.
If you want a corporate or business leader look, go for a modern office with a subtle blur. If you prefer a clean and minimal look, use a neutral gradient or solid color.
